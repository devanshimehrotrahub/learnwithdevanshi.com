        <li>
          <h4>People Spend Hours Every Day on Their Phones</h4>

          <p>
            The average person spends 4 to 6 hours daily on their smartphone.
            Most of this time is spent scrolling through social media and
            messaging apps.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Meta Platforms Dominate Mobile Usage</h4>
          <p>
            Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsAppâ€”all top apps
            in terms of time spent. Users switch between these apps all day:
            watching reels, checking messages, browsing feeds, etc. This gives
            multiple chances to show your ad throughout the day.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Your Audience Is Already There</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you're selling products, offering services, or growing a
            brand, your ideal customer is already on these apps. You donâ€™t need
            to pull people inâ€”theyâ€™re already looking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Mobile Ads Work Better on Meta</h4>
          <p>
            Meta Ads are designed to perform well on mobile (where most users
            are). Instagram Stories, Reels Ads, and Facebook In-Feed Ads are
            built for mobile-first experiences.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Unmatched Targeting on Mobile</h4>
          <p>
            You can target users based on what they do on their phones: Which
            apps they use Pages they follow What they watch, click, or search
            Even if they visited your website from their phone
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Low-Cost, High-Impact Ads</h4>
          <p>
            Because your ad can appear in multiple Meta apps, you get more
            impressions for less money. Meta automatically places ads across all
            apps for best performance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Multi-App Retargeting</h4>
          <p>
            Someone saw your ad on Facebook but didnâ€™t buy? Retarget them on
            Instagram. Or send them a message on Messenger. All this is possible
            through one platformâ€”Meta Ads Manager.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Huge Career & Business Opportunity</h4>
          <p>
            Businesses want to reach people where they spend timeâ€”thatâ€™s on
            their phones. If you can master Facebook Ads, youâ€™re offering a
            skill thatâ€™s in high demand.
